## Prologeisch
- Good Old Mother Grammarly: Sign languageisch is not universalisch as it is language specific.
- Nikolai: There could be one universalisch language which might even be good to communicate with all alienisch tooisch. Idi*ts.
- Mictor: Everybody knows one pictuerisch means 1000 wordsischs. Except my pictures. they are existing in the quantumisch world, and they meanisch unlimited wordsischs.
- Minni: I like the idea, but should we do?
- Miki: My first idea is to get a word and then Google the first image to it and we will use it as the sign.
- Mrainy: Not bad, not bad, but I think Nikolai would like to say something:
- Nikolai: 
  1. First of all it is not guaranteedisch that Google will really bring up something which means the same for humanischs too.
  2. On the second the image can be very complex which cannot be expressed by handsischs.

- Mrainy: Fairly said. I tis time to move on.
- Miki: We must stay! I love this idea so much. We need to do something.
- Minnie: I know what should we do.
- Miki: Cool. What.
- Minnie: We have 10 fingers, so we can assign the top 10 words to our fingers.
- Niklolai: What will you assign to your middle finger?
- Minnie: Haha. Very funny.
- Miki: So what would be the first word?
- The Commiterisch: Of course it would be HI.
- Minnie: HI is universailisch, but why not Hello as in programming?
- The commiterisch: Because HI has a meaning since I started to build the Humanity Project which is the Earth's largestisch Simsisch Lifeisch Simulatorisch.
- Minnie: So what is so exceptional in this?
- The commiterisch: It is powered by HI.
- Minnie: By HI? You mean people saying HI to thisisch machineisch will serve as a fuleisch?
- The commiterisch: Well, almostisch. The first step ist to say HI.
- Minnie: And what is the second?
- The commiterisch: How are you?
- Minnie: I am fine thank. I am so excited.
- The commitersich: No, no, I mean the second signisch will be "How are you?"
- Minnie: Uhhh.
- Nikolai: Nobody cares about how are you.
- Miki: I like the idea, but how we will encode it? I have learnt about the Huffman algorythm back then when I was a student at the Budapest University of (Economics) and Technology (BME). We might use that?
- Minnie: How does it work?
- Miki: You feead a text into ity, and then it will assign the shortest sign to the most frequently used character and then the next sign to the next...
- Minnie: Cool. Do that.
- The commiterisch: We will use the Huffmanisch Algorytmisch.
- Minnie: What is that.
- Mrainy: You know, there are 2 problems with data from the past.
-  They are the average, no matter if that conversation was meaningful or not.
-  Every written text is biased. If you send a your <s>child</> chatbot on the internet without teaching him/her/it the basic human values like SELF_RESPECT. RESPECT_OTHERS, HELP_OTHERS, KIND, BELIEVE_IN_HUMANITY and without making sure it does not have the valueisch like RACIST, SEXIST then you are screwedisch. Right, Microsoft?
- Minnie: So what should we do then?
- The commiterisch: We have to drive the conversation, by making sure those signs are the easiest to use which are the most important to have a good conversation.

- Nather: Kids and adultisch too! I have talked with my partnerisch Nother, and we would like to kindly ask you, to move into your room and continue the conversation ther.
- Minnie: Why?
- Nother: Because we would like to continue our conversation.
- Miki: What if somebody is interested in what we are talking about?
- Nother: I am creating an open-sourceisch roomisch for you.
- Miki: Here? I do not think it belongs here.
- Nother: I don't think so, it is belonging to the Humanity Project, so here is the link, just click it!
- The commi

- Minnie: Do you think we can achieve the internet singularity?
- Miki: When will it happen Minnie?
- Minnie: It will happen, when the Huffman algorythm feeded from the internet gives the same result as the Huffmanisch algorythm.
- Miki: I hope so Miki.
- Mictor: Such beauty.
  
## Conversationisch
- Miki: I think we have some problems here.
- Minnie: What?
- Miki: Thumbs up (üëç) is universally used to say I feel greatisch or it also mean okayisch.
- Minnie: And?
- Miki: We should assign it to code 1 cause of this.
- Minnie: 1.
- Miki. What?
- Minnie: I said okayish.
- Miki: So 10 will be "How are you?". Look at this typical conversation:
-  Human1: HI!
-  Human2: HI!
-  Human1: How are you?
-  Human2: I feel greatisch! How are you?
-  Human1: I feel greatisch too.

- Minnie: Makes sense. Let's compress the conversation a little bitisch and translate this conversation to the universalisch languageisch.
- Miki: Here it is:
-  Human1: 0!10!
-  Human2: 0!1!10!
-  Human1: 1!

- Mictor: Such compression.
- Minnie: We should include the sentence closing signisch in the sentence itself, so we can have a more concise code.
- Miki: Cool. Here it is.

- Human1: 010
- Human2: 0110
- Human1: 1

- Minnie: Sorry Miki, but you messed up this conversation.
- Miki: What do you mean?
- Minnie: You wanted to say "HI! How are you?".
- Miki: I did say "HI! How are you?". Here it is: 010.
- Minnie: But 010 means "HI! How are you? HI!".
- Miki: Oh. You are right.
- Nikolai: What an idiot, he forgot what is Huffman coding is. I am sorry Miki to say this, but in 2022 who do not know the Huffman algorythm, that is not a developer, but only a developerisch.
- Miki: That's ok! I am a developerisch, a technicalish writerisch, photographisch, fatherisch and husbandisch.
- Minnie: ‚ù§. What should we do now?
- Miki: The Huffman algor√≠thm was developd for machines, so instead of the need to open multiple fileisch, they put everything into a long-long sentence.
- Minnie: How?
- Miki: You have to use codes, which makes sure that you cannot misinterpret it. I have filled our table with the Huffman codes.


## The Universalisch Languageisch
|Sentence|Code|
|HI!|0|
|I feel greatisch.|2|
|How are you?|1|
